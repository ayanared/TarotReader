    name: "fool",
    number: 0,
    cardImage: "images/rwfool.jpg",
    info:"http://www.learntarot.com/maj00.htm",
    cardDescription: "The Fool is a very powerful card in the Tarot deck, usually representing a new beginning -- and, consequently, an end to something in your old life. The Fool's position in your spread reveals which aspects of your life may be subject to change. The Fool portends important decisions ahead which may not be easy to make, and involve an element of risk for you. Approach the changes with optimism and care to gain the most positive outcome."

    name: "the magician",
    number: 1,
    cardImage: "images/rwmagician.jpg",
    info:"http://www.learntarot.com/maj01.htm",
    cardDescription:"The Magician generally associates with intelligent and skillful communicators. His presence in your spread indicates a level of self-confidence and drive which allows you to translate ideas into action. A practical card, the revelations it brings are best applied to the pragmatic and physical aspects of your life, rather then the ephemeral or theoretical. Your success in upcoming ventures in politics or business will likely hinge upon your own strength of will and determination."

    name: "the high priestess",
    number: 2,
    cardImage: "images/rwhighpriestess.jpg",
    info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj02.htm",
    cardDescription: "Your identification with the High Priestess suggests you possess inherent good judgment, in the form of strong intuition. She may indicate that reason should take second place to instinct. Your head must trust in the wisdom of your heart for a change. Yet, she is also an aide by nature, and her presence in certain parts of your spread could be indicative of someone close to you coming to your rescue with their own intuition. Intuition is most effective at seeing what is hidden to the senses, so the High Priestess may also come as a warning of concealed facts or influences that are, or will be, important to you."

    name: "the empress",
    number: 3,
    cardImage: "images/rwempress.jpg",
    info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj03.htm",
    cardDescription: "Traditionally associated with strong maternal influence, the presence of the Empress is excellent news if you are looking for harmony in your marriage or hoping to start a family. Any artistic endeavours you are currently associated with are also likely to be more successful, as this card often finds those exposed to strong bursts of creative or artistic energy. That creative energy may not be in the form of a painting or art project, however: This card also suggests a very strong possibility of pregnancy -- not necessarily yours, but you might be seeing a new addition to your extended family or the family of a close friend in the near future! This card is a good portent for you and those around you."

  {
  name: "the emperor",
  number: 4,
  cardImage: "images/rwemperor.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj04.htm",
  cardDescription: "Counterpart to the Empress, the Emperor is signifies a powerful influence, generally male in nature. This can also include concepts in your life historically considered masculine, such as leadership and authority, self-discipline, and stability through the power of action. Its positive influences suggest you may be on a path to advancement or promotion, but it can also be neutral. Often a companion to those destined to take on greater responsibility, it may presage change or loss that necessitates you stepping forward to shoulder a greater burden than you have in the past. Whatever the impetus for the change, it indicates you may possess an uncommon inner strength that will compel you act and to lead."

{
name: "the hierophant",
number: 5,
cardImage: "images/rwhierophant.jpg",
info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj05.htm",
cardDescription: "Depending on your own nature, the Hierophant can mean very different things. At its root, it represents doctrine, but doctrine can come in the form of teaching and guidance or rigid authority. Where it appears in your spread is also important, as it is most often indicative of your own approach to the moral, religious, and social conventions of the world. Considered wisely, it helps show the path towards fulfillment."

},
{
  name: "the lovers",
  number: 6,
  cardImage: "images/rwlovers.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj06.htm",
  cardDescription: "Your first instinct will most likely be to associate this card as representing love, but, much like love, it does not possess a simple nature. Not only does love comes in many forms, but the Lovers may indicate important or difficult choices ahead in your life. This is bad, in that the choices it portends are generally mutually exclusive, paths to two very different futures, but also good, in that it also confirms that at least one of those paths will take you to a good place. As such, if you happen to find it in your spread, you should consider it carefully, but not fear it. It tells a story of difficult choices, likely painful, but that the correct decision and a positive outcome are within your grasp."
},
{
  name: "the chariot",
  number: 7,
  cardImage: "images/rwchariot.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj07.htm",
  cardDescription: "You have some hard work ahead of you. It may be resolved quickly, but the Chariot is a powerful card, and the labor you are undertaking will probably trend towards long and difficult. You will quite possibly experience rough roads, long uphill slopes, dead ends, and painful setbacks. A good outcome is only assured if the card is upright, but do not let yourself lose hope: This hard road will instil in you a strength of purpose, the ability to overcome through organization and endurance, and the confidence possessed only by those who have done what they thought they could not. Harnessed correctly, few forces can stand against an individual like that."
},
{
  name: "strength",
  number: 8,
  cardImage: "images/rwstrength.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj08.htm",
  cardDescription: "Strength is the rawest form of power, and you possess it in some form. It is a very happy card if you are fighting illness or recovering from injury. As might be suspected, its influence over you, and the use you put it to, can trend towards light or dark. You likely trend towards facing your problems courageously, head-on, and conquering them through perseverance and will. With this ability to overcome life's obstacles, though, comes the responsibility to control yourself, and it this card may be a warning to take command of your own actions or emotions before they damage you or the people you care about."
},
{
  name: "hermit",
  number: 9,
  cardImage: "images/rwhermit.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj09.htm",
  cardDescription: "There are times in every life, when one must step back and make a careful examination of their situations and decisions. Finding the Hermit in your spread suggests this is just such a time for you. You are in need of a period of inner reflection, away from the current demands of your position. This retreat can be physical, or a search within. Only a deep and honest introspection will lead to a solution, however.."

{
  name: "wheel of fortune",
  number: 10,
  cardImage: "images/rwwheelfortune.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj10.htm",
  cardDescription:"Symbolic of life's cycles, the Wheel of Fortune speaks to good beginnings. Most likely, you will find the events foretold to be positive, but, being aspects of luck, they may also be beyond your control and influence. Tend those things you can control with care, and learn not to agonize over the ones you cannot.."
},
{
  name: "justice",
  number: 11,
  cardImage: "images/rwjustice.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj11.htm",
  cardDescription:"Justice is a very good card to find in your spread if you have acted with kindness and fairness towards other and, especially, if you have been a victim. It is a significant indicator of a positive resolution, although how and what sort will depend on your own experiences. If you have been unfair, abusive, or otherwise shady and immoral in your dealings, though, pay heed. For the unjust, this card is, at best, a dire warning to change your ways before retribution falls upon you, and, at worst, a simple statement that it is already too late. In neutral cases, it may simply be telling you to seek out balance in your life."
},
{
  name: "the hanged man",
  number: 12,
  cardImage: "images/rwhangedman.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj12.htm",
  cardDescription:"The Hanged Man can be interpreted in two very different ways. All change is a small kind of death, as the old must die to create the new, and it may simply indicate upheaval or change in your future, perhaps beyond your control, but more likely a decision that, for good or ill, you will not be able to turn back from. The other interpretation is one of sacrifice, although whether this sacrifice is small or great may not be easily interpreted. Both interpretations imply permanence, and that you should give very careful thought to the decisions in your life."
},
{
  name: "death",
  number: 13,
  cardImage: "images/rwdeath.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj13.htm",
  cardDescription:"Death is indicative of change in your future. This change can be in almost any aspect of your life, but it will almost certainly be permanent, significant, and absolute. Death suggests a complete severance between the past and the future, and it will likely be painful. Despite the sense of loss that may accompany it, Death fills an important and natural role in life, and leads eventually to acceptance. It is a necessary part of moving forward, and you will find the changes easiest if you embrace them, rather than fight them. Expect the end of a close friendship, a job, a marriage, or even a life, but do not focus too greatly on the negative."
},
{
  name: "temperance",
  number: 14,
  cardImage: "images/rwtemperance.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj14.htm",
  cardDescription:"An optimistic card, Temperance encourages you to find balance in your life and approach problems with a calm demeanour. It recognizes that opposing forces need not be at war within you. Tread carefully in any major decisions you make, with confidence that good decisions will lead to a good resolution for you."
},
{
  name: "the devil",
  number: 15,
  cardImage: "images/rwdevil.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj15.htm",
  cardDescription:"The Devil is in the business of entrapment. It signifies a situation from which there is no escape, or a road leading to one. Forewarning may let you avoid the trap, or it may not. What sort of trap, and how you might avoid it, depends on where the Devil appears in your spread, and what other cards surround it. This card does not foretell doom, only the need for prudence."
},
{
  name: "the tower",
  number: 16,
  cardImage: "images/rwtower.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj16.htm",
  cardDescription:"Dark and foreboding, the Tower is the embodiment of disruption and conflict. Not just change, but the abrupt and jarring movement caused by the unforeseen and traumatic events which are part of life. The Tower in your spread is always a threat, but life inevitably involves tragedy, and you must decide whether you will face it with grace."
},
{
  name: "the star",
  number: 17,
  cardImage: "images/rwstar.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj17.htm",
  cardDescription:"The Star's presence signifies a period of respite and renewal for you. This renewal may be spiritual, physical, or both. It is a particularly positive sign if you or someone close is recovering from illness or injury. It is a light in the darkness, illuminating your future and your past."
},
{
  name: "the moon",
  number: 18,
  cardImage: "images/rwmoon.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj18.htm",
  cardDescription:"Something in your life is not what it seems. Perhaps a misunderstanding on your part, or a truth you cannot admit to yourself. It may also indicate something important being kept from you by another. This may be a source of worry or depression in your life, and the Moon is a strong indicator that you must rely on your intuition to see through the subterfuge."
},

{
  name: "the sun",
  number: 19,
  cardImage: "images/rwsun.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj19.htm",
  cardDescription:"As an inherently good influence, finding the Sun is a positive development. It is suggestive of personal gain, and that personal goals and joy are within reach, if you are willing to invest the effort to actualize them. If you are embarking on a new personal venture, such as marriage or beginning a family, the Sun is of particular influence."
},
{
  name: "judgement",
  number: 20,
  cardImage: "images/rwjudgement.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj20.htm",
  cardDescription:"Judgment tells a story of transition, but unlike Death or the Tower, it is not sudden change, or born of luck or intuition, but change that springs from reason. It signifies plans, often long in the making, coming to fruition. If it points towards the future, it may also speak towards the nature of the change; if there is a choice that needs to be made, ruminate and let your mind guide the decision. Logic, in this case, is a better guide than intuition. Be prepared to make a major decision in your life, likely one that will shape the next chapter of your life."
},
{
  name: "the world",
  number: 21,
  cardImage: "images/rwworld.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj21.htm",
  cardDescription:"The World is an indicator of a major and inexorable change, of tectonic breadth. This change represents a chance for you to bring about a desirable end to the Old and a good beginning to the New. It is indicative of growing maturity, a sense of inner balance and deeper understanding. It suggests that you may be approaching a more final sense of identity, and the security in the self that comes with age. It also represents the falling away of boundaries, sometimes in the effusive sense of the spiritual, but sometimes in a purely physical sense, indicating travels or journeys in the future."
},
{
  name: "ace of cups",
  number: 22,
  cardImage: "images/rwacecups.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/ca.htm",
  cardDescription:"The Ace of Cups signifies the beginning of period of strong emotional health for you. Expect copious joy, happiness, and love to surround you during this time. Existing personal relationships may strengthen, meaningful new ones are likely to form. If marriage is in your future, you are likely to lay the foundations for it during this time."

{
  name: "ace of wands",
  number: 23,
  cardImage: "images/rwacewands.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/wa.htm",
  cardDescription:"Drawing the Ace of Wands strongly suggests a new business enterprise being undertaken, traditionally, although some also interpret it to indicate childbirth. It speaks more strongly to the characteristics you will need to succeed in these new conditions. You will need to harness your potential for innovation, enthusiasm, and ambition to bring about a successful outcome."
},
{
  name: "ace of swords",
  number: 24,
  cardImage: "images/rwaceswords.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/sa.htm",
  cardDescription:"The Ace of Swords is, like all of the Aces, the purest embodiment of its suit. In relation to your personality or your actions it implies a strong element of focus, determination, and an intellectual capacity. It may suggest change through warring forces, possibly internal; conflicts of not necessarily overt reasoning regarding inner consciousness, keep energetic to triumph."
},
{
  name: "ace of pentacles",
  number: 25,
  cardImage: "images/rwacepentacles.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/pa.htm",
  cardDescription:"Aces always represent a new beginning in some form, and the Ace of Pentacles suggests a strongly positive one for you. Your life is about to enter a very productive period -- or at least a period which will see your work rewarded in good measure to the level of work you are willing to perform. This period will also see most of your relationship on stable ground, and, despite the hard work you may be doing, you will be very content with your situation."

{
  name: "two of wands",
  number: 26,
  cardImage: "images/rw02wands.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/w2.htm",
  cardDescription:"The II of Wands suggests the formation of partnerships in your immediate future, or the success of already existing joint ventures. You will likely find yourself in a position to reap the rewards of these partnerships, in the form of financial gain or promotion. One the same count, the rewards indicated are those fairly due to you, so this is better news for those in equitable partnerships than those who seek to profit at the expense of others. The presence of this card may also point to underlying insecurity or worry on your part. These feelings may be justified or not, based on the rest of the spread.."
},
{
  name: "two of cups",
  number: 27,
  cardImage: "images/rw02cups.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/c2.htm",
  cardDescription:"The single resounding theme associated with the II of Cups is partnership. What sort of partnership is less clear, but you are in the past, present, or future, part of a powerful one. This partnership will involve absolute trust and commanding respect. It may, of course, be a particularly emotional love affair, but it could just as easily be a deep and abiding friendship. The exact nature may be revealed by the rest of the spread, or it may not. It will be a source of happiness for you, though, a presence in your life you can count on at every turn, and whose well-being will be as important to you as your own."

{
  name: "two of swords",
  number: 28,
  cardImage: "images/rw02swords.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/s2.htm",
  cardDescription:"Like crossed blades, the II of Swords represents a balance of forces. Not necessarily an absence of struggle, but an equal distribution of force in opposition. It may indicate you are in a position to mediate a conflict, or it may instead suggest you are caught in the middle of a dilemma with no clear outcome. The resolution of this state will likely bring peace for you."

{
  name: "two of pentacles",
  number: 29,
  cardImage: "images/rw02pentacles.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/p2.htm",
  cardDescription: "The II is, as always, bound up in the forces of change, and of balance. Like its brothers, the II of Pentacles can mean good or ill, but it as a strong indicator that the status quo will be disrupted. There will be challenges in your future, but your fate is largely in your own hands in the sense that the final outcome depends own how you respond to these challenges. The suit of this card suggests your best outcome is one that can be reached through prudence and careful planning."

  cardImage: "images/rw03wands.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/w3.htm",
  cardDescription:"If you can bring the fullness of your creativity and inventiveness to the table, then the III of Wands brings good news. You are about to enter a time where your potential for productivity and accomplishment is very favourable. Keep your eyes open for new career opportunities and your mind open to new possibilities. The rewards these new opportunities bring, however, will only come in the fullness of time. You will need to be patient and stick around for the long haul. Also, look for new allies, as any new undertakings will be most successful if undertaken as partnerships."

  number: 31,

  cardDescription:"This card is both a portent of celebration and cause for it. It tells of great happiness in the future for you, and not of the passing kind, but secure joy which will last and be shared with those around you. Commonly associated with the completion of a meaningful project, or, even more likely, a birth."

  number: 32,
  cardImage: "images/rw03swords.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/s3.htm",
  cardDescription:"The presence of the III of Swords in your spread suggests significant pain in your life. This pain is likely caused by or the result of conflict, perhaps due to disrupted partnership or friendship. This pain may be part of a new beginning, but you must face your pain honestly to overcome it."

  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/p3.htm",
  cardDescription: "If you can maintain a clear sense of purpose over the coming months, you are well positioned to see you hard work get the recognition it deserves. It is not guaranteed, but if you maintain your own pace, and it may tax your interpersonal skills, as you will need to rely and trust on others for the best outcome. That outcome will be worth your determination, however, not only providing material reward, but leading to a sense of lasting accomplishment."

  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/w4.htm",
  cardDescription:"Peace and security follow in the wake of the Four of Wands, usually in the smaller aspects of your life. Do not let the limited scope bring you to underestimate the joy that simple successes can bring, however: This is a card of good endings and fresh starts. Its presence should be welcome if you are beginning a new relationship -- or a new phase of one, such as marriage or engagement -- and is especially good for those about to move residences."

  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/c4.htm",
  cardDescription:"Apathy is the most insidious of evil. If its influence remains unchecked you may lose yourself, and not even realize what you have lost. This card is a strong warning that you must break out of your current cycles. Seek out causes or people to care and fight for. Make new goals, and then seek out new paths to reach them. Now is the time to take risks, as the price of failure is far less than the cost of no longer seeking success."

  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/c5.htm",
  cardDescription: "This card is a dark omen. Like the rest of its suit, it is bound your emotions, and it brings with it a warning of loss and disappointment. Expect a setback in your life, almost certainly emotional. While this may be emotional, it may be a project or goal you are particularly invested in, emotionally. In certain positions it might also refer to events of the past which continue to cause regret or heartache. The only solution is optimism; this too shall pass."

  cardDescription:"This card indicates conflict in your life. Worse yet, it is closely associated with defeat. It is likely that the defeat will be traumatic, and you will need to retreat and regroup. Your may have suffered injury to your pride or self-esteem, but the V of Swords is also a warning of a potential to get caught in the cycle. Handle defeat with grace, move on, and success will come to you."

  cardDescription:"The V of Pentacles can, depending on the rest of your spread, refer to financial matters, employment, or relationships. Unfortunately, it is a negative indicator for all of them, suggesting duplicity, loss of jobs, and the possibility of infidelity. This is a time for you to carefully evaluate what matters in your life and work out your priorities, such as whether your job or your relationship matters most. In order to mitigate the damage in some areas of your life, you may have to let some of the other fall away."

Whether in the form of recognition for your past work or material reward, some level of success is in your future. If you are waiting for some particular news, this card is most likely a portent of good news. However, it is also gentle reminder that magnanimity and grace should accompany your success. To avoid losing friends and inviting retributions, do not let the good fortune go to your head."

It suggests that your family, your old friends, perhaps even past lovers, are in the process of adding greatly to the joys in your life. This card may also refer to past efforts, labours of love, and personal projects rewarding you, usually in an emotional sense, rather than financial."

  cardDescription:"Success in your life is bound up to generosity. This may mean your prosperity will arise from your investment in others, perhaps a financial investment, or maybe advice and support for a friend. This card can also mean the reverse, that your success will arise from the generosity of someone else. The two are, of course, not exclusive, and drawing this card suggests you naturally lean towards benevolent acts and charity."

  cardDescription:"You almost certainly have great reserves of courage, and the perseverance to see yourself through difficult times. You may not be aware you possess these qualities, but you will find yourself needing them soon. Expect conflicts, possibly small, but more likely significant. It is not certain where they will arise, but there is no doubt you possess the ability to overcome your adversaries."

  number: 47,
  cardImage: "images/rw07cups.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/c7.htm",
  cardDescription:"This card speaks strongly to your inner self. It is trying to tell you something about your unconscious or the realms of your imagination. Your hopes, dreams, and unrealized aspirations are all fair game to the VII of Cups. It speaks of a deep confusion, or a lack of understanding of your true motivations by your conscious mind. It is time to look carefully at your own motivations and reexamine your goals, but it is also a risky time to act upon your conclusions."

  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/s7.htm",
  cardDescription:"Another card which indicates forces opposing you, the VII of Swords points to there being a single source of your frustration. This is both positive, in that you may be able to identify that source and change your circumstances, and negative, in that this source may well be aware of you and deliberately sabotaging you. The road to your success does not lie in direct confrontation, however, but instead in guile. Instead of attacking the obstacles raised against you, find ways around them."
