    cardDescription: "The Fool represents the roots of one's abilities, talents and potential. \
    Decision to start fresh, open to new possibilities within, not explored yet. \
    Sudden impulse which comes 'out of the blue'. Like a young animal driven into\
     life by instinct, not yet conscious or possessed of understanding. The hero \
     of our journey represents the irrational impulse toward change and toward \
     opening life's horizon into the unknown. These irrational impulses can sometimes \
     be destructive and sometimes creative and often they are both together. \
     Willingness to risk, courage to stand by oneself, independence, freedom, \
     following one's own feeling, idealism and inspiration.\

    the ultimate achiever. He symbolizes the power to tap universal forces and use them \
    for creative purposes. Note his stance in the picture. He acts as a lightening rod - \

    life-giving Mother who reigns over the bounty of nature and the rhythms of the Earth. \
    From her comes all the pleasures and joys of the senses and the abundance of new life \
    in all its forms. The Empress encourages you to strengthen your connections with the \
    natural world which is the ground of our being. Too often false sophistications and \
    pleasures take us far from our roots. Let the Empress remind you to keep your feet \

 Suffering in ordinary life make us question and open the way to a greater \
 understanding of the higher laws of life. He is seeking for answers of a \
 philosophical kind and a link between spiritual and material values, an advisor, \

  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj06.htm",
  cardDescription: "The Lovers are meeting between the cutting power of mind - the sword - and \
  the cup of love, which is a symbol of relationship. This dilemma is not only \
  about trying to decide between two men or two woman. It also reflects our values, \
  because our choices mirror back to us the kind of person we wish to become. Here \
  is the problem of free will versus the compulsions of the instincts. Without \
  passing through this initiation by fire, we cannot understand how we create our \
  own future. It is the encounter with feelings, love and beauty, passion and \
  faithfulness, the harmony, uniting of differences. It represents the creation \
  of the world - the marriage of duality, by love awareness happens and in this \
  surrender new doors open.\
Negative: driven blindly by desires, doubtful."

   instinct, with enthusiasm and vitality moves beyond boredom and daily routine.\
    This victory is a combination of physical, intellectual and spiritual powers \
    and reflects the potential for both good and evil. On an inner level, the \
    chariot is an image of the aggressive instincts guided and directed by the\
     will of consciousness. It means to face the anger and conflict which he has \
     invoked with his desire to possess a beautiful object, the choice of his love. \
     It is a change to good, an introspection and this conflict cannot be avoided, \
     but needs to be faced with strength and containment.\
Negative: lust for destruction, brute strength and lack of refinement."

{
  name: "strength",
  number: 8,
  cardImage: "images/rwstrength.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj08.htm",
  cardDescription: "The Strength card is associated with the lion we have an image of courage, strength\
   and self-discipline of totally egocentric beginnings of a unique individuality. \
   It's the 'me first drive' which will happily destroy anyone or anything in its \
   path, so long as one's own gratification is assured. This lesson of harnessing \
   one's aggression and directing it toward a creative end. Will courage pride and \
   labor, going for it for the lust of life. Strength applied to joyful purpose. \
   Through such an experience we come in contact with the beast but also with the \
   hero, emerging from this contest with trust in oneself and integrity towards \
   others. The lion within is the image of the infantile savage and royalty, \
   interpreted as vigor.\
Negative: Repressed instinct without any transformation, leaving behind a strong \
shell within a soul without passion and without a true identity."

  cardImage: "images/rwhermit.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj09.htm",
  cardDescription: "The Hermit symbolizes the time for meditation, for looking inward bringing light into \
  darkness, the unconscious, watching the dreams. Here we have loneliness, active \
  or passive isolation to connect the higher spiritual self - a communication \
  between spiritual heaven and material earth. A wise leader, finding one's own \
  light, bringing things to completion, time to harvest, the fruitfulness. We \
  only can reach this maturity with caution and patience, with readiness to \
  reflect upon the 'dark side of the moon'. There is an opportunity to build \
  solid foundations if one is willing to wait. Finally there is a deep respect \
  for own limitations in the great passage of the rounds of time.\

  cardImage: "images/rwwheelfortune.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj10.htm",
  cardDescription:"The Wheel of Fortune card says: Here comes a big breakthrough, the unexpected luck - a new \
  self-realization, the personal destiny. Whirling energies and the effect of \
  the incalculable factor brings the hazard, something new, we call it fate. It \
  can be a sudden change of fortune that overturns the established pattern of life. \
  This is part of the unconscious personality and we only become aware of them \
  through their outward effects, which feel like fate, yet which spring not from \
  some external power but from within the depths of the soul. The wheel is constantly \
  moving, but the center is unchanging - essence of source.\

  cardDescription:"The Justice cards represents the weapons - which have to be \
  used with intelligence, foresight and planning. Here we have the mind capacity \
  to integrate both dark and light with logic, diplomacy and cleverness. The \
  capacity to make choices based upon reflection, holding the instincts in control.\
   The willingness to battle for principles rather than passions, not influenced \
   by personal desire. The necessity of building one's own character, which helps \
   to deal with the great range of life's experiences. Justice is not possible unless \
   we respect fairness and truth as important ethical principles rather than a nice \
   behavior which we adopt because we want to be liked by others. Honesty, balance, \
   order and organization are necessary for decisions and the real power, which comes \
   from insight.\
   Negative: cool, too idealistic and too destructive to the warmth of personal relationship."

  cardDescription:"The Death card represents an ending. Every end is a transformation, \
  a release, a renewal and purification, an opportunity for a new life, if one can \
  let go of the old one. Whether or not this experience is painful depends upon the \
  person's capacity to accept and recognize the necessity of endings. It is an inner \
  change, the ability to regenerate and the key to hidden wisdom. Death and rebirth \
  for an unknown future.\
Negative: Depression, because there has not yet been an acknowledgment that a phase \
of life has died at the same time that a new thing has been born."

  cardImage: "images/rwtemperance.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj14.htm",
  cardDescription:"The Temperance card signifies finding the middle ground. \
  A quantum leap, a bridge between heaven and earth inviting the polar opposites, \
  the creative forces of masculine and feminine, conscious and unconscious, \
  the sun and the moon., fire and water. Connected with the function of feeling, \
  the active, intelligent faculty of choice, a constantly changing bridge between \
  these opposites, a careful sensing of the needs of a particular situation with \
  the goal of harmony and relationship, balance and tolerance at the end. \
  It is an integration of creative power inviting the others to share.\
Negative: Too much harmony oriented, where no change is allowed to occur and \
the mind suffocates from sheer boredom. "

  name: "the devil",
  number: 15,
  cardImage: "images/rwdevil.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj15.htm",
  cardDescription:"The Devil card implies the necessity of a confrontation with all \
  that is shadowy, shameful and base in the personality like sexuality, antagonism,\
   obscure unrestrained energy, obsession, superstition. He is ugly, amoral and crude,\
    has dirty and wicked fantasies and is goatish, hairy and inferior. To release the \
    creative power one must free oneself by gaining knowledge and honest, dropping the \
    chains of panic and self-disgust, facing the own darkness. One must learn to confront \
    with humility, the basest and most shameful aspects, otherwise one remains forever \
    in the bondage of one's own fear.\
Negative: Careless of result."

{
  name: "the tower",
  number: 16,
  cardImage: "images/rwtower.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj16.htm",
  cardDescription:"The Tower card represents a powerful instinctual force emerging \
  from the unconscious, stronger than the will's efforts to repress it, collapse \
  of old forms, inner and outer structure, of false or outgrown values, masks, \
  costumes in a play to impress the audience, structures we build in the outside \
  world to embody our incomplete selves. The tower represents achievement, authority \
  and protection is now in a state of breakdown and dissolution. Let go of fear and \
  the survival instinct to face the unknown implies the fall, ruin, punishment and loss,\
imprisonment and danger. But it also means freedom from stagnation and restriction - \
a spiritual healing force. This break-through will result in changes occurring in outer life.\
Negative: Without looking inward it can be a stagnant state."

  the harmonious uniting of heaven and earth, the divine protection and power to \
  transcend the mundane world., the inspiration, crystallization, self-confidence, \
  the conjunction with the universal intellect. And the insight that there are \
  endless possibilities of existence we connect with our feeling, instinct, imagination\
   and intuition. It is a symbol of that part of us which, despite disappointment, \
   depression and loss can still cling to a sense of meaning and value and a future \
   might grow out of unhappiness of the past, a time of sincerity, trust and peace.\

  number: 18,
  cardImage: "images/rwmoon.jpg",
  info: "http://www.learntarot.com/maj18.htm",
  cardDescription:"The Moon card represents our fears, shadows, and anxieties.  \
   The moon is seen full only when \
   it is in exact opposition to the sun. It represents the feminine, feelings and \
   the unconscious. It is elusive and fluctuating. This concealment is the end of \
   karma and it represents passivity, a progression in deepening understanding \
   and experience of the world of dreams and images. It is a meeting with a \
   transpersonal world, where individual boundaries dissolve and the sense of \
   direction and ego are lost. A rebirth in the waters of a greater womb, dimly \
   aware that the journey of personal development is only a small fragment of a \
   vast, unknowable life.\

  cardDescription:"The World card represents the great cycle of the Major Arcana ends where it begins, \
  the unborn potential of the personality ultimately leads to the birth of freedom,\
   open to all possibilities, crazy enough to start again. But with the joy of \
   living we have this deep longing to complete. This synthesis brings the objective, \
   this being outside of oneself, no ego - completion of karma. Costumes are of no \
   use anymore, free from chains we are immortal and complete, polarities like male \
   and female melt, integrate within the individuality with it's potential of \
   imagination, feeling, mind and matter. We are human and therefore imperfect \
   and the divine androgen is beyond our reach - there lies our total victory, \
   waiting for us all the time."
